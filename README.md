# Liquidity-Locker

A smart contract that can be deployed to any EVM chain to lockup LP tokens for Uniswap or any forks of it, such as Pancake or Sushi.

The contract works by adding in a date that must be reached before the LP tokens stored in the contract can be withdrawn.

Edit the contract and deploy to suit your needs.

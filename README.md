# Liquidity-Locker

A smart contract that can be deployed to any EVM chain to lockup LP tokens for Uniswap or any forks of it.

The contract works by adding in a date that must be reached before the LP tokens stored in the contract can be withdrawn.

Edit the contract and deploy to suit your needs.
